I created this javascript canvas to test out some circle collision.

The larger game piece is moved by the keyboard arrows. As you collide with the smaller pieces you will grow.
The smaller pieces move about the canvas, currently moving towards the bottom only. I have plans to tweak this, making it more 'random' or perhaps make this a game where you are a spider catching bugs in your web.
